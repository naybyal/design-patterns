# Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to establish a one-to-many dependency relationship. In this pattern, there are two main components: the subject and the observers.

## Subject

The subject is the object that holds the state and notifies the observers when its state changes. It provides methods to attach, detach, and notify observers. When the subject's state changes, it iterates through its list of observers and calls their update methods.

## Observer

The observer is the object that wants to be notified of changes in the subject's state. It implements an update method that is called by the subject when its state changes. The observer can then retrieve the updated state from the subject and perform any necessary actions.

## Benefits of the Observer Pattern

- Loose coupling: The subject and observers are loosely coupled, as they don't need to have direct knowledge of each other. They only depend on the subject's interface.
- Easy extensibility: It's easy to add new observers without modifying the subject or other observers.
- Separation of concerns: The subject is responsible for managing the state, while the observers are responsible for reacting to state changes. This separation allows for better organization and maintainability of the code.

## Example Usage

One common example of the Observer pattern is in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). For instance, a button can be the subject, and various UI components (such as labels or text fields) can be observers. When the button is clicked, it notifies all the observers, and they can update their state accordingly.
